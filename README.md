A GPS bus tracking application for Android phones.  I was the project manager in charge of requirements gathering, 
task delegation, all documentation/presentations, and UI design.  The majority of the Java coding was done by other 
team members, and thus I have not listed it here on my personal git page.  This is more to show the work I did as
the project manager.

Our group's final report is 462_Project.pdf in the repository above.
